# Verification record · 2026-10-19

The standalone Hypersnap entry passes `cd hypersnap && yarn verify`: **184 tests** (29 gateway, 10 media Worker, 11 API, 10 pairing boundary, 8 native signer, 26 auth, 8 vault, 24 wallet provider, 13 WalletConnect adapter, 7 SDK lifecycle, 1 independent Rust protocol golden vector, 8 navigation, 3 profile validation, 20 UTF-8 mention, and 6 media helper), TypeScript for browser/Worker/native code, and browser plus native payload builds.

The social client update uses Hypersnap commit `2e8733d044141ad3ba0e0592a4d5873c1dc6ce9c` as its wire/API reference. No Farcaster-hosted HTTP, websocket, authentication or Snapchain integration was imported from the MIT client snapshot. Default keys retain `[1,3,4]`; an explicit wallet review can authorize a new key for `[1,3,4,5,6,11]`. Synthetic tests cover exact expanded KEY_ADD signatures, link/user-data wire fields, current custody/scope checks, vault compatibility, partial profile saves and unknown-write quarantine. Profile banner writes remain excluded because of Hypersnap's Pro restriction and hydration limitations.

Anonymous browser smoke verified `/profile/<fid>` resolution, follower-list loading, profile navigation/Back, canonical cast sharing with clipboard feedback, `/cast/<hash>` conversation navigation and hard reload, nested reply rendering, share dialog above a conversation, and the explicit social-permission review without any wallet approval or submission. The owner previously reported a successful Rainbow account connection. Agent checks never used real account keys or performed follow, profile, cast or reaction writes.

Media checks use synthetic identities and mocked registries. Sixteen media tests plus an isolated real Cloudflare runtime smoke verified signed uploads, replay rejection, actual SQLite Durable Object reservations, immutable R2 reads, duplicate-content writes, and revocation during transfer. The dedicated private R2 bucket exists; original public images retain photo metadata and have no end-user deletion flow. See [MEDIA.md](MEDIA.md) for limits, quotas, deployment bindings and testing boundaries.


Wallet tests use independent viem EIP-712 hashing and synthetic keys to verify exact KeyAdd, SignedKeyRequest, and KeyRemove compatibility. They cover custody mismatch, account/network changes, rejected or malformed signatures, bounded timeouts, cancellation between prompts, provider discovery and untrusted metadata. Vault tests include actual IndexedDB transactions across two connections, preventing another tab’s replacement vault from being erased. Unknown network writes are never automatically resubmitted.


WalletConnect uses the current pinned 2.26.0 SignClient/Core with the project owner’s explicit approval of its Community License and external relay. The project ID is configured in ignored local build environment files and a GitHub Actions public repository variable; no Dashboard API secret is used. Runtime dependency audit reported zero advisories. The SDK is lazy-loaded, uses fresh memory storage and a unique prefix, disables telemetry and global Core caching, permits only the exact displayed typed-data operation, and clears local session/pairing keys during bounded cleanup. The temporary nonsecret SDK environment flag is restored after initialization.

A live browser pairing with the supplied project ID produced a real local QR and canonical wallet-app links. A separate synthetic SignClient peer settled the restricted Mainnet namespace, received and checked the exact FID 1234 KeyAdd scopes `[1,3,4]` and TTL `604800`, then returned user rejection code 5000. The browser showed the controlled rejection, cleared pairing UI, and kept network submission disabled. The synthetic test produced no signature or Hypersnap write; its private temporary pairing file was deleted and relay keys cleared. Rainbow mobile pairing and pending-signature reopening routes were added from its official RainbowKit connector and app handler. The same 110-test gate and production browser/native builds passed after this change. Physical mobile-wallet approval remains untested by agents; the owner later reported successful Rainbow extension connection.

Rainbow browser extension support uses EIP-6963 `me.rainbow` plus its official direct `window.rainbow`, `isRainbow`, and bounded legacy provider-list shapes. Nine additional discovery regressions cover competing extensions, copied announcements, late identification, retained provider references, wallet caps, and untrusted getters/metadata. The 119-test gate and production browser/native builds passed. The browser-wallet UI comes first, prioritizes detected Rainbow, and offers official extension setup guidance when absent. No real extension approval or Hypersnap mutation was performed by agents.

Native UI smoke verified importing a public synthetic request, reviewing public account/key/permissions, signing with a public test-only 24-word phrase, clearing its input, and exporting an approval whose signatures then verified cryptographically. Browser smoke covered public account lookup, phrase-free sign-in, mobile wallet guidance, and rejecting an approval for another request. Native payload builds were repeated and their manifests matched.

Live integration checks perform public reads only. No real wallet approval, signer registration/removal, cast, or reaction was submitted. Physical iOS/Android wallet approval remains untested. Cross-platform support uses documented EIP-1193/EIP-6963 and typed-data-v4 interfaces; it is not a claim that every wallet/browser combination works. No independent security audit is claimed. The optional macOS beta is Developer ID signed; notarization is deferred.

The live node’s HTTP `requesterFids` sequence query fails to decode; bracket queries are ignored. The UI therefore supports custody-approved removal through wallet or offline signatures using the current user nonce, rather than guessing an app nonce. No upstream node mutation was performed.

The Worker uses manual redirects and rejects all upstream redirects, with regression coverage for Cloudflare runtime compatibility.

The retained Quorum messenger is separate. Its root verification was attempted but cannot run its tools without the original dependencies and sibling shared/SDK repositories. Its permanent-account mint guard was respected. This is the complete recorded verdict from the social client update (line-end padding omitted), not a passing messenger regression run:

  VERDICT  FAIL — see the failing step above
           ⚠ live arms were skipped because this machine has no persisted bot identities — running them would register permanent, undeletable accounts and Spaces on the PRODUCTION relay. The fast tier ran in full. `yarn verify --live-allow-minting` accepts that cost deliberately.
           ⚠ This does NOT clear a change that touches shared or the wire.
